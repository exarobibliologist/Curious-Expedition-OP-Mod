# Curious Expedition OP Mod
OPgear is an overpowered mod for Curious Expedition 1.

This is my first mod. I wasn't happy with other OP mods (either too overpowered, or not powered enough) so I tweaked and recoded them, then merged all my little mods together into this mod.

This has been recoded so much that it can be considered a new mod, even if the results are similar to other mods.


OP Character
-----
A lizard warrior with +40 health, 4 bonuses (Polymath, Cooking 4, Healer, and OP Status). Only comes equipped with the OP objects below (like you would need anything else!?)

OP Status
-----
A new bonus status that you can get at the end of a quest. OP Character comes with this status at the beginning of the game.

`Sanity +50, Combat Rolls +3, also pulls out random items from the OP Chest every few days`

Op Chest
-----
A bag of holding (bonus +30 capacity). Click on the bag to pull random useful items and treasure out.

OP Glasses
-----
Augmented Reality Headset. Improves your view distance a little. Click on the glasses to get bonus Score, Standing, and Funds

OP Watch
-----
A smartwatch cellphone. Bonus +10 Units for an expedition. Click on the watch to summon a unit to the expedition.

OP Radar
-----
Radar that reveals all the quest locations on the map.

Willy Wonka's Everlasting Gobstopper
-----
Sanity food that never runs out. Click to instantly refill sanity.
