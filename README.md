# Curious Expedition OP Mod
OPgear is an overpowered mod for Curious Expedition 1.

This is my first mod. Originally I got the code from other mods published on Steam, but I wasn't happy with how other OP mods played so I tweaked and recoded them, then merged them all together into this mod. This has been recoded so much that it can be considered a new mod, even if the results are similar.

It contains

OP Character
-----
The overpowered lizard warrior "OP Character" - 40 health, comes equipped with the 4 OP objects below)

Op Chest
-----
A bag of holding (bonus +30 capacity). Click on the bag to pull random useful items and treasure out.

OP Glasses
-----
Augmented Reality Headset. Improves your view distance a little. Click on the glasses to get bonus Score, Standing, and Funds

OP Watch
-----
A smartwatch cellphone. Bonus +10 Units for an expedition. Click on the watch to summon a unit to the expedition.
