# Curious Expedition OP Mod
OPgear is an overpowered mod for Curious Expedition 1.

This is my first mod. I wasn't happy with other OP mods (either too overpowered, or not powered enough) so I tweaked and recoded them, then merged all my little mods together into this mod.

This has been recoded so much that it can be considered a new mod, even if the results are similar to other mods.
